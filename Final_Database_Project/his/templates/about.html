                      <h2>Clinic Service</h2>
                      <p class="lead">The Cardiology Department offers "Same Day Appointments" where the patient can see one of our cardiology consultants, have all their cardiac investigations done on the same day, receive the test results and see the cardiologist one more time at the end of the day to check the tests and investigations and hand the diagnosis and treatment recommendations to the patient.
                      We also offer an extensive cardiac rehabilitation program for patients who have undergone cardiac procedures; from exercise to diet, our consultant will make sure you learn and practice all that's needed to keep your heart healthy.
                      Our cardiology team has performed more than 25,000 procedures and examined more than 100,000 patients in our clinics throughout 15 years.</p>
